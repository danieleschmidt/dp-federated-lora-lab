## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Autonomous SDLC System
The Terragon system is already configured in `.terragon/` directory:
```bash
# Value discovery engine (comprehensive)
.terragon/value-discovery.py

# Simple discovery engine (lightweight)  
.terragon/simple-discovery.py

# Autonomous executor
.terragon/autonomous-executor.py

# Configuration and metrics
.terragon/config.yaml
.terragon/execution-metrics.json
```

### 2. Deploy GitHub Actions Workflows
```bash
# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy autonomous workflows (recommended)
cp docs/github-workflows/autonomous-ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
cp docs/github-workflows/autonomous-security.yml .github/workflows/security.yml

# Or copy standard workflows
cp docs/github-workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/github-workflows/release.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets
```bash
# Required for all workflows
CODECOV_TOKEN=<coverage-reporting-token>
PYPI_TOKEN=<pypi-publishing-token>

# Optional for enhanced features
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=<docker-hub-username>  
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN=<docker-hub-access-token>
```

### 4. Enable Autonomous Features
Once deployed, the autonomous system will:
- ✅ Run value discovery after every successful CI build
- 📅 Execute weekly autonomous enhancements (Mondays at 2 AM)
- 📝 Generate PRs with prioritized improvements
- 📊 Update BACKLOG.md with discovered opportunities
- 🧠 Learn from execution outcomes to improve future predictions

## 🔍 Autonomous SDLC Features

### Value Discovery Sources
```python
# Multi-source analysis for comprehensive coverage
sources = [
    "git_history",      # TODO, FIXME, technical debt patterns
    "static_analysis",  # Import issues, complexity metrics  
    "security_scans",   # Vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies
    "test_analysis",    # Coverage gaps, mutation testing opportunities
    "config_review"     # Missing tooling, inconsistencies
]
```

### Scoring Algorithm
```python
# Composite scoring for optimal prioritization
WSJF = (UserValue + TimeCriticality + RiskReduction + OpportunityEnablement) / JobSize
ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease  
TechnicalDebt = (DebtImpact + DebtInterest) × HotspotMultiplier

# Adaptive weighting based on repository maturity
CompositeScore = (
    weights.wsjf × normalized(WSJF) +
    weights.ice × normalized(ICE) + 
    weights.debt × normalized(TechnicalDebt)
) × SecurityBoost × ComplianceBoost
```

### Autonomous Execution Cycle
1. **🔍 Discovery**: Multi-source value item identification
2. **📊 Scoring**: Composite prioritization with adaptive weights
3. **🎯 Selection**: Risk-adjusted item selection for execution
4. **🚀 Implementation**: Autonomous code generation and testing
5. **✅ Validation**: Comprehensive quality gates and rollback
6. **📈 Learning**: Outcome tracking and model refinement
7. **🔄 Repeat**: Perpetual cycle triggered by repository events
