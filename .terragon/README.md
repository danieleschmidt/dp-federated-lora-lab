# ü§ñ Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

This directory contains the Terragon Autonomous SDLC enhancement system for continuous value discovery and execution.

## üéØ System Overview

The Terragon system implements perpetual value discovery and autonomous execution for SDLC improvements:

- **Value Discovery Engine**: Continuously analyzes repository for improvement opportunities
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Uses WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt scoring for prioritization  
- **Autonomous Executor**: Implements highest-value items with full validation
- **Continuous Learning**: Tracks outcomes to improve future predictions

## üìÅ Components

### `config.yaml`
Repository configuration and maturity assessment:
- Classification (language, framework, domain)
- Maturity scores across SDLC dimensions
- Scoring weights and thresholds
- Enhancement priorities

### `value-discovery.py` 
Comprehensive value discovery engine:
- Multi-source signal harvesting (git, static analysis, security)
- Advanced scoring with WSJF/ICE/TechnicalDebt composite
- Backlog generation and metrics tracking

### `simple-discovery.py`
Lightweight discovery engine for demonstration:
- Essential gap detection (missing modules, CI/CD, testing)
- Simplified scoring algorithm
- Quick backlog generation

### `autonomous-executor.py`
Autonomous implementation framework:
- Executes highest-priority value items
- Comprehensive validation and rollback
- Metrics tracking for continuous learning
- PR creation and review management

## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Discovery
```bash
# Run comprehensive value discovery
python3 .terragon/value-discovery.py

# Run simplified discovery  
python3 .terragon/simple-discovery.py

# Execute next best value item
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### Automated Integration
The system integrates with:
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Value discovery on push
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous execution on PR merge
- **Scheduled runs**: Weekly deep analysis and strategic review

## üìä Value Discovery Sources

### Static Analysis
- Import dependency analysis
- Configuration consistency checks
- Code complexity and maintainability metrics
- Technical debt pattern detection

### Git History Analysis
- Commit message debt indicators (TODO, FIXME, HACK)
- File churn and complexity correlation
- Bug-fix pattern analysis
- Developer velocity and bottleneck identification

### Security Analysis  
- Vulnerability scanning (Safety, Bandit, Trivy)
- Dependency audit and update recommendations
- Secrets detection and policy compliance
- Container and infrastructure security

### Test Analysis
- Coverage gap identification
- Mutation testing integration opportunities
- Performance regression detection
- Test quality and maintenance burden

## üéØ Scoring Algorithm

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size

Cost of Delay = UserBusinessValue + TimeCriticality + RiskReduction + OpportunityEnablement
```

### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
```
ICE = Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease
```

### Technical Debt Score
```
TechnicalDebtScore = (DebtImpact + DebtInterest) √ó HotspotMultiplier
```

### Composite Score (Adaptive Weights)
```
CompositeScore = (
  weights.wsjf √ó normalized(WSJF) +
  weights.ice √ó normalized(ICE) + 
  weights.debt √ó normalized(TechnicalDebtScore)
) √ó SecurityBoost √ó ComplianceBoost
```

## üìà Metrics & Learning

### Execution Metrics
- Item completion rate and cycle time
- Accuracy of effort estimation
- Value prediction vs actual impact
- Rollback frequency and root causes

### Repository Health Metrics
- SDLC maturity progression
- Technical debt accumulation/reduction
- Security posture improvements
- Developer velocity changes

### Learning Outcomes
- Scoring model refinement based on outcomes
- Pattern recognition for similar repositories
- Risk assessment improvement
- Velocity optimization through process learning

## üîÑ Continuous Enhancement Cycle

1. **Discovery**: Multi-source value item identification
2. **Scoring**: Composite prioritization with adaptive weights
3. **Selection**: Risk-adjusted item selection for execution
4. **Implementation**: Autonomous code generation and testing
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive quality gates and rollback
6. **Learning**: Outcome tracking and model refinement
7. **Repeat**: Perpetual cycle triggered by repository events

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Governance

### Rollback Mechanisms
- Automated rollback on test failures
- Git branch isolation for all changes
- Incremental implementation with validation gates
- Human review requirement for high-risk changes

### Quality Assurance
- Multi-stage validation pipeline
- Code owner approval for sensitive areas
- Security scanning on all generated code
- Performance regression detection

### Learning & Adaptation
- Continuous model refinement based on outcomes
- Repository-specific pattern recognition
- Cross-repository knowledge transfer
- Human feedback integration
