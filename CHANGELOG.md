## Release Notes

### Privacy Guarantees
This release provides formal (ε, δ)-differential privacy guarantees:
- **Default Configuration**: ε=8.0, δ=1e-5
- **Strong Privacy**: ε=1.0, δ=1e-6 (with 15-20% accuracy trade-off)
- **Relaxed Privacy**: ε=50.0, δ=1e-4 (minimal accuracy impact)

### Performance Benchmarks
On standard federated learning benchmarks:
- **LLaMA-7B + GLUE**: 84.7% accuracy (ε=8.0) vs 88.2% baseline
- **Training Speed**: 2.3x slower than non-private due to DP overhead
- **Memory Usage**: 1.4x baseline due to privacy accounting
- **Communication**: 0.1x baseline due to LoRA efficiency

### Known Limitations
- GPU memory requirements increase with privacy budget tracking
- Performance degrades with very strict privacy (ε < 1.0)
- Byzantine robustness assumes < 1/3 malicious clients
- Requires CUDA for optimal performance

### Migration Guide
This is the initial release, so no migration is required.

### Breaking Changes
None (initial release).

### Deprecations
None (initial release).

## Future Roadmap

### Version 0.2.0 (Planned)
- Cross-silo federated learning support
- Advanced privacy mechanisms (LDP, shuffle model)
- Mobile device optimization
- Kubernetes deployment templates

### Version 0.3.0 (Planned)
- Multi-modal federated learning (text + vision)
- Federated prompt tuning
- Privacy-preserving evaluation protocols
- Advanced Byzantine detection

### Version 1.0.0 (Planned)
- Production-ready deployment tools
- Compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Enterprise security features
- Certified privacy implementations
