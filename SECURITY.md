## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@terragonlabs.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, privacy leak)
2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact assessment** including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Privacy-Specific Vulnerabilities

For differential privacy and federated learning vulnerabilities, also include:

- **Privacy budget implications** and potential epsilon/delta violations
- **Data leakage scenarios** through model updates or aggregation
- **Membership inference attack** vectors
- **Model extraction** or reconstruction possibilities
- **Byzantine attack** scenarios in federated settings

## 🔒 Security Guarantees

This project aims to provide:

### Differential Privacy
- **Formal privacy guarantees** with (ε, δ)-differential privacy
- **Privacy budget accounting** across federated rounds
- **Composition theorem compliance** for privacy amplification
- **Secure noise generation** using cryptographically secure RNGs

### Federated Security
- **Secure aggregation** preventing intermediate result disclosure
- **Byzantine robustness** against malicious participants
- **Communication encryption** for all client-server interactions
- **Input validation** to prevent injection attacks

### Implementation Security
- **Memory safety** for sensitive computations
- **Secure deletion** of intermediate values
- **Constant-time operations** where applicable
- **Side-channel resistance** for privacy-critical paths

## ⚡ Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your email within **48 hours** and provide a detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply, we will:
1. **Investigate** the issue and determine impact
2. **Develop and test** fixes
3. **Coordinate disclosure** with the reporter
4. **Release patches** and security advisories

## 🏆 Recognition

We believe in responsible disclosure and will recognize security researchers who help improve our security:

- **Security Hall of Fame** on our website
- **CVE credit** where applicable  
- **Bug bounty consideration** for critical findings (case-by-case basis)

## 🔐 Cryptographic Dependencies

This project relies on several cryptographic libraries:

### Core Dependencies
- **PyTorch Cryptography**: For secure aggregation protocols
- **OpenSSL**: Through Python's `cryptography` library
- **Opacus**: For differential privacy implementations

### Security Assumptions
- **Trusted setup**: Server and aggregation node integrity
- **Secure channels**: TLS/HTTPS communication assumed
- **Random number generation**: System entropy sources

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** covered by this security policy:

- **Social engineering** attacks against users
- **Physical security** of deployment environments  
- **Third-party integrations** (WandB, external APIs)
- **DoS attacks** through resource exhaustion
- **Issues in dependencies** (report to upstream maintainers)
